                    <h1>MATE ROV</h1>
                </div>
                <p>Going into my sophomore year of high school, I had done some form of competition robotics for 4 years at that point. My experiences on teams in FLL, FTC, and FRC taught me many skills about both the fundamentals and technical details of robotics as well as the engineering design process and teamwork that it took to compete at the highest level every year.</p>
                <p>After these experiences, I moved on to compete in the MATE (Marine Advanced Technology Education) ROV competition. The team I joined, Kepler Enterprises, had multiple members with prior experience in MATE and expertise in their own fields. While FIRST Robotics emphasizes teamwork and collaboration through robotics, MATE is structured to simulate each team as a company competing for a contract. This structure forced teams to learn skills that are directly applicable in the real world but aren't emphasized in school or other competitions. Things such as cost, manufacturability, and even our ability to sell the product through additional features such as modularity and portability would never even be considered in FIRST. </p>
                <p>I had multiple roles on the team, and most of my time was split between either assisting in the design and fabrication processes or writing the technical documentation. Both of these roles required heavy collaboration with every member of the team and the application of skills such as CAD, waterproof fabrication, and technical writing.</p>

                    <h1>KEPLER ENTERPRISES</h1>
                </div>
                <p>After the COVID pandemic lockdowns began, MATE quickly informed the teams that no competition would be taking place that year. This pushed us as a team to shift our focus onto the pandemic and how we as team of engineers could help make a difference.</p>
                <p>Inspired by others' efforts to supplement the ongoing shortage of life saving ventilation devices, we began brainstorming ways to take a simple breathing bag and automate it so that one healthcare worker wouldn't be limited to only helping a single patient at a time when they were needed the most. All of the skills we had learned together in MATE applied heavily, as we took into consideration everything beyond just the concepts of robotics. </p>
                <p>After multiple designs, our final prototype cost under 10% of a standard hospital ventilator, was lightweight, portable, and only required readily available electronics and parts to manufacture. Our ventilator also had features beyond just automating a simple hand-pumped bag. Variables such as pressure, volume, and breaths per minute could all be adjusted, and the inclusion of a pressure sensor and Arduino allowed for the ventilator to assist the user in their breaths, instead of painfully forcing air into the lungs, just like a real ventilator.</p>

                <div class = "projdesc">
                    <p>At my first hackathon, I competed on a team with both my brother and sister. After brainstorming ideas together, we decided to code a game in Unity that would compete in the educational category of the hackathon. None of us had ever used Unity before this, and it was my first time coding in C#. Our game, QuickMath, was intended to be a fun way to teach arithmetic to young kids. The player was a cube that continuously traveled down an infinite path, and as the player was prompted overhead with math problems, they could answer by running the cube through the block in the path with the correct answer. Our project won best overall in the education category.</p>

                <div class = "projdesc">
                    <p>At the same hackathon the next year, my brother and I showed up with a new project in mind. Inspired by our older sister's journey through the pre-med process, we wanted to make an iOS app that could help new students manage everything through the complicated process. This was my first large project working with xCode and Swift. Our project, Pre-MD, gave the user access to organizational and scheduling tools specific to pre-med students, and it had direct access to study and learning resources for both university study and the MCATs. Our project won first runner up in the app category at the hackathon.</p>
