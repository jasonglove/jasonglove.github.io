                    <h1>YOUTH ORCHESTRAS OF SAN ANTONIO</h1>
                </div>
                <p>In the summer after my freshman year of high school, I auditioned for the summer orchestras program with YOSA. My audition placed me in the highest-level summer ensemble, and I even earned a spot in the second-highest orchestra for the YOSA season.</p>
                <p>For the next two years, I qualified to play with YOSA's philharmonic orchestra which was the top group of musicians. The opportunities I got with YOSA were unlike anything else. I had the chance to perform amongst the best youth players from the entire city, and we tackled advanced repertoire such as Pictures at an Exhibition, Mahler 5, Beethoven 8, and even a ballet of Scheherezade featuring the city's youth ballet. </p>
                <p>After my final season with YOSA came to a conclusion, I had the chance to travel with the ensemble to three cities in the Northeast. The entire experience was incredible, but my growth as a musician in such a short time span was unlike anything I had the opportunity to experience before. With just five rehearsals before performing a final concert and flying to Boston, I had to put hours and hours of practice into days that were already occupied with hours of rehearsal as an ensemble. All of the work was well worth it.</p>
                <p>Our tour included performances in Worcester, Philidelphia, and Carnegie Hall in New York. I also had the opportunity to play alongside professional pianist Adam Tendler with the orchestra during our performances. Our repertoire included Gershwin's Second Rhapsody, The Bamboula by Coleridge-Taylor, Verdi's Nabucco Overture, Sibelius' Karelia Suite, and more.</p>

                    <h1>LEGACY ORCHESTRA</h1>
                </div>
                <p>I have been involved in my high schools's orchestra program for four years. My very first year, I was placed into the freshman orchestra, but after seeing my skill level, the orchestra director moved me up to the highest level orchestra for the second semester so I could compete at the University Interscholastic League competition with the group. By the end of my freshman year I was already the principal bassist in the varsity orchestra. This required me to take on many leadership roles quite early. Every week, I would lead sectionals for the basses, despite not even being an upperclassman. Without even a years experience in the ensamble, I was expected to set an example for others.</p>
                <p>I continued to play my part as the bass section leader, and in my senior year I ran for president of the orchestras. I was elected by my peers to be president which met I was not only a leader to those in my section or my ensamble but to the program as a whole. This became especially apparent when only three weeks before our first concert of the year, the orchestras' director was out with COVID for two weeks. As there was a shortage of subs capable of conducting and teaching any music classes, I took charge and stepped up. For both the varsity and freshman orchestras, I learned how to conduct and teach not just the basses, but the entirety of the two orchestras the music while our director was out. The positive feedback from my peers at this time, and the quality of our performance made me see that I have what it takes to step up and lead in times of pressure where someone to lead is needed.</p>

                    <h1>MARIACHI UNIDO</h1>
                </div>
                <p>My junior year of high school, I was asked by the orchestra director to play in the school's mariachi program. Although it is unconventional for mariachis to feature a double bass, there were no guitarrón players on the campus, and my teacher knew that with my talent and dedication to the program I could improvise a way to get the mariachi feel from in my sound.</p>
                <p>This was by far the most unique musical experience I had from my time in high school, and I gained so much from it. My orchestral performances would see me dressed in all black on a stage reading music from a stand surrounded by dozens of other musicians led by a conductor, but mariachi was different in every way. Our group had many gigs, some even paid to provide money to the program, and as such we learned nearly an hours worth of songs to be able to go to any event and entertain the masses. There were only about a dozen of us in the mariachi, and I was the lone bass player. This meant in a lot of cases that I was the one to count of the group for songs and lead the tempo as a conductor would in an orchestra.</p>
                <p>Two of the hardest things about mariachi were learning to improvise basslines, and learning how to sing well. Orchestral playing, while still involving interpretation and musicality, is about accuracy especially when playing in groups with eighty plus members. This is far different form mariachi where I don't have to play the notes on the page exactly, because half the time there was no page to begin with. Although I had the technical skills to perform highly complex bass solos, building up the musical skills to improvise notes that fit into a song is much harder than it sounds. On top off all of this I had to learn to sing the songs at the same time. It didn't take long to find out that playing and singing wasn't my strong suit, especially given that my singing wasn't anything to brag about to begin with. Eventually, I got the hang of it, and I am proud of myself to this day for the hard work I put into being a better performer.</p>

                    <p>Nearing the end of my final semester as a high schooler, I was asked by the director of bands to play both electric and upright jazz bass for the school's jazz band, the LEE Tones. I was immediately placed into a position within the ensemble that required leadership as the drummer and I were the two responsible for driving the direction of the song, and I even was given solos for my first performance with the group. We went on to perform at the school's band's final concert as well as a region-wide jazz competition.</p>

                    <p>Before I was approached to join the jazz band, I was asked by the director of bands to be one of three members playing in the pit for the school musical. The performance of Little Shop of Horrors only required three musicians one of whom the school hired a professional. This meant that the only slots to be filled were for a drummer and electric bassist. The experience overall was super fun and taught me new skills musically while giving me the opportunity to work with the drummer and director I would go on to play in the jazz band with.</p>
